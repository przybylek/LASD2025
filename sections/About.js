    <p>The international conference on Lean and Agile Software Development (LASD) was founded in 2017 as a part of the FedCSIS multiconference. The conference grew each year until 2020 when it noticed a substantial decline in the number of submissions. To remedy this issue, in 2021 and 2022, LASD was held as a standalone, free of charge conference. In 2023, it joined ACM SAC as a track. In 2024, it was held twice: first at SAC and later at ISD.</p>
    <p><strong>The objective of LASD is to advance the state-of-the-art in lean and agile software development and disseminate best practices, along with success stories of successful transitions and adaptations to the evolving work environment.</strong></p> 
    <p>LASD has already established itself as a prominent forum where practitioners, researchers, and academics meet to share and discuss their concerns, experience, and research findings. 
 It is also renowned for its conscientious PC members, who diligently provide detailed reviews of journal-quality standards.</p>
